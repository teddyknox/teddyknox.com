Shitttt. I just spent the past two hours laughing at youtube videos with a girl who's with someone. It felt like a date, but we called it a meeting. I could drive myself crazy wondering whether our flirting was just friendly.

Afterwards we walked back in the dark together, making each other smile without trying. When we reached the fork in the path to our dorms we kept talking, squaring up and smiling face to face. For the few minutes that we stood there, I wouldn't allow my mind to wander to thinking of what it meant, or whether there was a move I could make. Just being with her made me hopeful that we would stand there for longer.

She began to step away and close the conversation, and I continued to talk at the place where her face had been. She joked about this reaction and I had to joke back.

As soon as I stepped inside Forest I realized how frustrated I felt. I couldn't help feeling alive around her, but I felt like I had no control over that feeling. I wanted to ask her to my room, where we could get cozy and continue talking together. But that's a line that I haven't crossed, even if it seems harmless. It makes me sad. We're reaching out for each other, but she won't allow for ourselves to touch. I have to work with her, I can't help liking her, and I can't become any closer to her. I feel like a dog chasing a bone hung in front of his face. I'm put in a position where it would be fine for me to acknowledge the feelings, but she might not allow herself to. Should I save myself the heartache and stop reaching out for streetlight moments like these? Or should I take what we both know is there and deal with the consequences?
