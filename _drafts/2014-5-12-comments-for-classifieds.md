So from looking at the facebook group 13K strong named "Buy, Sell, Swap & Trade, Vermont", we can learn a few things about current alternative resale markets, and where they have room to improve. 

### 1. Simplicity is a feature. 

A listing in this FB group is a wall post with item description and attached photos. Discussions occur in a linear comment thread. Potential buyers browse listings like they browse facebook posts, in roughly chronological order, with the consideration of popularity and relevance. This browsing approach seems almost too simple to me.

On a whole, the system apparently works well, showing us yet again that you don't need a ton of features to launch a classifieds platform.

### 2. Moderation is important.

The group admin does most of the moderation to ensure that the users comply to the rules. No businesses, no stock photos, no agressive "post bumping", no being an asshole. I'd assume that active normal users of the group help police it also. So it seems like the method of moderation here doesn't differ much from Craigslist, only the rules to be moderated. By coming up with new rules, you can come up with a new kind of community; the conventional mechanism for enforcing rules online seems to work very well.

### 3. Location is still relevant. 

Why is this group specific to Vermont? Why not Burlington, or Addison County, or New England? I think it's to keep the size of the group right, geographically and by user count. Burlington would be too small, New England would be too big. The users want to be able to casually browse and follow listings without being inundated with posts. They also want to be able to casually meet the seller, and pick up the item for sale.

### 4. Verification matters.

This is where the Facebook group really one-ups the Craigslist listing.
