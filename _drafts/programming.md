I'm taking this crazy PSCI course called "Politics of Virtual Realities" by the amazing Professor Stanger at Middlebury College. We're learning about how government, law, and society will have to adapt to the inevitable progress of technology as we brave the age of computing. We're touching on topics ranging from intellectual property rights, to theories of representation in a digital democracy, to privacy ethics. We're reading a lot of stuff. 

I was talking to Prof. Stanger after class, and she mentioned the idea of having the class learn the basics of programming instead of discussing the reading one morning. I said that it was a great idea, I'd tutored CS 101 on weeknights and found that about one class period is all anybody needs to begin to understand how computers work and why they're great. She asked me if I could develop a recommmendation for an online programming tutorial for the session, and I said "sure".

I was already aware of sites like Codecademy.com and KhanAcademy.org, but I was interested to see if there any broader and more academic options existed. And they do. I found Eloquentjavascript.net, an online textbook with a mature approach and has javascript snippets that you can executable and modify built-in. My research was not terribly extendsive, and I'm sure if I searched some more I would be able to find what I was looking for. The problem I'm addressing here is that the approach I was looking for is not the default approach in introductions to Computer Science.

I was looking for 1 hour and 15 minutes of the most interesting, relevant and important concepts in computing, targeted at smart college students with no computing background. 

Anybody could spend a semester slowly learning how to program. It doesn't matter if that process is facilitated through a crazy gamified REPL website or though a boring textbook. Clearly one approach is easier than the other, but I've begun to realize that both make the same mistake of equating understanding computers with understanding programming. Learning to program should not be the step one. Step one should be learning how computers work.

The standard way of approaching this.. start with 1s and 0s and you'll end up with `while`s and `for`s. But intelligent liberal-arts students were never interested in the 1s and 0s.. clearly boolean logic and control structures are not most fascinating concept of computer technology. We should start with the most _awesome_ stuff first, and leave the boring stuff for computer architecture class.

It seems inconsistent that despite all the ingenious abstractions introduced to programming over the years, few have become integrated deeply into its introduction. The first hour and fifteen minutes of every CS 101 should be fucking epic! I don't have to work hard to get myself excited about computers, programming, technology, and the future. If someone came up to me and asked me to get them excited too, I would lament about the exponential gains unlocked by the interconnectivity of the internet, our youthful understanding of computers, and our primitive understanding of the most complex thing we've ever found.. which sits between our ears. I could talk for days. But in the face of all of this fascinating progress humanity has made as a result of these fast, stupid machines, CS deptartments usually start their intro classes with the history of computing.
