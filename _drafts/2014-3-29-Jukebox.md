![Keeping this in mind](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png)

There's an itch I need to scratch, and it has to do with how we listen to online music. The web has recently become saturated with proprietary music streaming services, making it easy listen to music but difficult to keep a consolidated library of songs. Like most people, I keep a collection of mp3s which I sync, play, and organize using iTunes, but I also listen to music on [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com), [8Tracks](http://8tracks.com), [Spotify](https://spotify.com), [The Hype Machine](http://hypem.com), and of course [YouTube](http://youtube.com). From what I can tell there are a lot of kids my age (20) who don't bother to organize their music locally because of ease of these services. 

The problem is that much of this music is available only for streaming. Each service offers its own form of playlisting in the cloud to get around this, but these virtual playlists are far from ideal. Keeping a smartphone cached full of songs you like for a metro commute has become a _serious task_. I keep five different music apps to play from five different lists "starred", "favorited", or "liked" songs. Some of these apps force you to stream the songs every time, and some are smart enough to cache them. Some of them them have interfaces I like, and some of them don't. And all these music service apps have a ton of overlapping functionality: they download and display playlists, then stream and cache songs from them. There must be a more interoperable way we could be doing all of this to allow for the separation responsibilities of hosting music publicly, organizing a personal library, and playing of those songs from those playlists.

I want to propose a loose standard for non-proprietary web music playlists and their hosting, and announce an interim solution I'm working on to ease compliance.

The web playlists will be simply structured JSON files with standardized attribute names. As I gain more experience with the various formats these services currently use, I'll form a better picture of what this will look like.

I've also started writing a service that will let its users keep a centralized public record of the metadata of their web playlists in the form of standardized json format. The user's native interactions with the various music services will trigger those playlist files to update on this service.

Down the road, I will use these public playlist files to build a music player client for OS X and iOS that will intelligently stream from these various services.

After that, I want to implement local iTunes integration, by writing an Tunes match clone. It would take the form of a script that would first look to match local mp3s with music available in the cloud, and then upload any unmatched mp3s to s3 for commodity prices. Finally it would construct web playlists from existing iTunes playlists (including the global library playlist).

Please post thoughts or feedback to the Hacker News comments thread, I want to make a service that people will use!
