At age 11, about halfway through the 5th grade, I was diagnosed with ADHD. My doctor prescribed me 25mg of Strattera, a relatively new drug that showed effectiveness without the side effects of normal stimulants. 

I don't remember much of my life before Strattera. My parents tell me endearlingly that I was a energetic, smart and lovable kid, with no problem hyper-focusing on friends, books, legos and computers. I remember the downsides of my unmedicated pre-teen self clearly. My short attention-span, impulsivity, and hyperactivity occassionally lead me to act in ways that offended classmates, despite my futile attempts to "sit still".

Life got a lot better for me after I began taking the drug. Sitting still was suddenly possible, and I was able to focus on work that I didn't want to do. Incidents of embarrassing impulsiveness stopped happening. After a little we upped my dosage, and for the rest of Middle School, high school, and freshman year of college, I took a pill every morning, acting mostly normal. 

Strattera's active ingredient is molecule called Atomoxetine, which increases the availability of stress neurotransmitter Norepinepherine in the brain without making you feel wired. For a long time I believed that because Strattera wasn't a stimulant, it didn't carry any of the behavioural side effects of drugs like Ritalin. Fearful of the behavior the drug continued to mask, I didn't consider the possibility that I had outgrown it after 7 years.

As I took the drug in middle school and high school my personality subtly shifted from affable and clumsy to introverted and self-conscious. Most who've taken ADHD drugs can attest to this kind of personality change. Even on Strattera I felt that I had trouble working on long papers while others didn't. In search for a pharmaceutical solution, I asked my doctor for Concerta (Ritalin), hoping it would fix all my problems. In the my mind, the second drug might have made me more outgoing and less self-conscious. Obviously it didn't. I was even more self-centered and linear. Deep down, I was nervous all of the time. I bit my nails, ended conversations early out of a need to feed productive, and didn't consider opening my world to new people. Holding creative conversation was difficult and made me nervous. My friends told me I was less fun to be around and blamed the new drug. They occassionally had taken Ritalin to help them study, and were aware of the side effects. 

After dropping Concerta I regained my baseline level of personality and creativity, I wondered if dropping Strattera might unlock a similarly restrained part of my creative self. So over the course of a month a weaned off Atomoxetine, and then dropped it. Which sucked a lot more than dropping Concerta. With Strattera you have to take a pill for about 2 weeks to feel any effect, and you have to deal with 2 weeks of mild withdrawal to get off of it. But after dealing with a scary rebound of ADHD symptoms, my attention and impulsivity have some settled to an almost normal equilibrium. And this is really weird to me.

I had thought it was a myth that some people outgrow ADHD.
