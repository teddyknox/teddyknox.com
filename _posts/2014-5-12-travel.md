What was the biggest surprise of your trip?

To be honest, before the trip I never thought realistically about the details of what I would be doing on it. I didn't see much point in visualizing the semester because I wanted it to be a suprise, like presents on Christmas. I wouldn't do it this way again, but I think I got what I wanted. Everything about India suprised me, because I really had no idea what to expect. I chose it because it was a big blind spot of mine. I was suprised by how conductive the country was to the unexpected... to hilarious stories and interesting people. In one day in Sri Lanka, we watched a dog and reptile fight (it was a Land Monitor apparently), we laid on a tropical beach as a military chopper ripped close overhead, we learned stories of the Sri Lankan civil war from an elderly muted man, and I lost my toenail to Dylan and his cot. Absurdity found us, not the other way around.

I also didn't expect living and traveling with an unfamiliar group from college to be so demanding. Forming sustainable relationships with people I would normally avoid doesn't come naturally to me. The big takeaway for me was to chill out in conflicts; it's often better to choose deferential and friendly over honest and blunt, even if it feels a little "phony". Then you can look that person in the eye later without a bitter taste in your mouth.
