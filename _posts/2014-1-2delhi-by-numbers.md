- 3 lectures on avoiding street food
- 1 street snack
- 7 meals by our amazing Ashok, the cook
- 6 hours riding the Indian metro
- Thousands of Indian faces
- 76 photos (5 Instagrams)
- 4 samosas
- 4 shopping hikes around the Lajpat Nagar bazaar
- 1 visit to Ruby Tuesday India
- 10 rickshaw rides
- Hundreds of rickshaw driver soliciations
