In preparation for my upcoming interview with Twitter, I wrote a program in python that randomly generates a grid of letters based on their frequency in the english language, loads the system dictionary into a hashtree, and then recursively searches the board for the longest word it can find.

Here's some sample output of the program:

Here's the code:

I'll try and update this post later on with an explanation of the code.
